## Examples

### Example 1: Cold Outreach to Recruiter

**Subject**: Data Science Role at TechCorp - Mutual Connection

**Body**:
Hi Sarah,

I noticed you're leading data science recruiting at TechCorp, and I saw your recent post about the company's AI initiatives - the work on real-time recommendation systems sounds fascinating.

I'm a data scientist with 5 years experience building ML pipelines, and I'm particularly drawn to TechCorp's focus on production ML systems. My recent project reduced prediction latency by 60% while improving accuracy, which seems aligned with your team's challenges.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to discuss opportunities on your team? I'd love to learn more about the technical challenges you're solving.

Thanks for considering,

### Example 2: Networking Introduction

**Subject**: Fellow React Developer - Would Love to Connect

**Body**:
Hi Marcus,

I came across your article on React performance optimization and really appreciated your insights on useMemo best practices - it helped me solve a rendering issue I was struggling with.

I'm a frontend developer also working in the fintech space, and I'm always looking to connect with others building high-performance React applications. Your work at FinanceApp on real-time dashboards is particularly interesting to me.

I'd love to connect and potentially exchange ideas on React patterns and fintech challenges.

Best,
[Name]

### Example 3: Referral Request

**Subject**: Quick Question About DataCorp Opportunity

**Body**:
Hi Jennifer,

I hope you're doing well! I really enjoyed our conversation at the React conference last month about component architecture patterns.

I'm currently exploring new opportunities and noticed that DataCorp (where you work) has an opening for a Senior Frontend Engineer. The role seems like a great fit for my experience building design systems and leading frontend teams.

If you're comfortable, I'd really appreciate any insights about the team or role, or an introduction to the hiring manager. Of course, no pressure at all - I completely understand if you'd prefer not to.

Either way, thanks for considering, and I hope to stay in touch!

Best regards,
