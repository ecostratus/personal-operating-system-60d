# Master Roadmap

Date: January 11, 2026

## Milestones
- v0.3.0 — Phase 3C: Normalization boundaries established and stable.
- v0.3.5 — Phase 3E: CLI + prompt rendering aligned; FUTURE-only content gated.
- v0.3.6 — Phase 3F: Runner + Sources Import Hardening Complete.

## Notes
- Preserve Phase 3C normalization boundaries across all modules.
- FUTURE-only features for 3D/3E remain gated until post-Phase 3C.
- Continue increasing test coverage and operational polish without changing public surfaces.
