# Phase 3D → Phase 3E Release Plan

## Phase 3D Completion Criteria
- Lever, Greenhouse, Ashby, Indeed adapters implemented (opt-in by config)
- Optional adapters scaffolded (JobSpy, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs, Glassdoor, Craigslist, GoRemote)
- Multi-source ingestion deterministic (canonical `job_id`, sorted, de-duplicated)
- Transform expansion complete; normalization boundaries upheld
- Config surfaces stable; structured logging consistent across sources
- v0.3.x release series complete

## Phase 3E Goals
- Outreach generation v1
- Resume tailoring v1
- Interview prep prompt engine
- Cross-behavior enrichment reuse
- Behavior-level metrics
- Behavior-level structured logging
- v0.4.0 release milestone

## Phase 3E Entry Conditions
- Canonical job objects stable
- Deterministic tags (stack, domain, seniority)
- Multi-source ingestion validated
- No normalization drift
- No orchestrator drift
