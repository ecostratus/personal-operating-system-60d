# v0.3.7 — Phase 3G: Interview Prep Hardening

Date: January 11, 2026

## Summary
Hardens interview-prep modules for import robustness and deterministic behavior. Applies two-stage imports (dotted → dynamic fallback), function-scoped loaders, and repo-root-relative dynamic loading. Adds logging + metrics events and tests (dynamic import + snapshots).

## Planned Changes
- Two-stage imports across interview-prep scripts and shared utilities.
- Deterministic context assembly and template selection.
- Logging + metrics events (start, context_loaded, variant_selected, rendered, saved).
- Snapshot tests for interview prompts.
- Dynamic import tests for interview modules.

## Validation
- Tests: `pytest -q --tb=short` (include snapshot + dynamic import).
- Docs CI: `python3 scripts/ci/check_docs.py`.
- Runner smoke test for interview-prep entry.

## Boundaries
- Preserve Phase 3C normalization boundaries.
- No changes to schema, orchestrator flags, or public APIs.
