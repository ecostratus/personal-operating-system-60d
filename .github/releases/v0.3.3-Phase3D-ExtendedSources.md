## v0.3.3 — Phase 3D: Extended Sources

Release date: 2026-01-10

### Summary
Adds deterministic, config‑gated adapters and documentation for multiple job sources, extending Phase 3D beyond Lever. All adapters are pure functions with canonical mapping, stable IDs, and zero orchestrator drift.

### What’s Added
- Adapters added/scaffolded:
  - Greenhouse, Ashby, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs, Glassdoor, Craigslist, GoRemote
- Deterministic behavior:
  - Canonical `job_id` = SHA‑256 of lower‑trimmed `title|company|url` (truncated to 16 hex)
  - Sorted outputs; de‑duplication by `job_id`
  - `posted_at` defaults to UTC `YYYY‑MM‑DD` when missing
- Documentation:
  - README enablement notes for all new sources (disabled by default)
  - Field Mapping Reference expanded with per‑source → canonical mappings
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for Lever/Greenhouse/Ashby/Indeed covering mapping, gating, determinism, and malformed handling
  - Full suite passing; deterministic repeat runs

### Configuration
- New opt‑in flags/endpoints in `config/env.sample.json`; e.g. `GREENHOUSE_ENABLED`, `GREENHOUSE_API_URL`, `ASHBY_ENABLED`, `ASHBY_API_URL`, `ASHBY_API_KEY`, etc.
- All adapters remain disabled by default to prevent behavioral drift.

### Compatibility
- No orchestrator changes; integration test stays skip‑based until orchestrator exists.
- Cross‑source `job_id` compatibility maintained.

### Upgrading
- Update your `config/env.json` with the new keys if enabling sources.
- Enable sources explicitly by setting `*_ENABLED` to `true` and providing URLs/API keys.
