## v0.3.4 — Phase 3D: Orchestrator

Release date: 2026-01-10

### Summary
Locks the ingestion layer with a multi‑source orchestrator and integration tests. Produces a single canonical job list with deterministic ordering and cross‑source de‑duplication.

### What’s Added
- Orchestrator function `fetch_all_sources(cfg)`:
  - Stable adapter registry (Lever, Greenhouse, Ashby, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs, Glassdoor, Craigslist, GoRemote)
  - Config‑gated activation per source
  - Cross‑source de‑duplication by `job_id`
  - Deterministic ordering by `job_id`
- Integration tests:
  - Validates deduplication and determinism with identical canonical jobs across sources
- Documentation:
  - Orchestrator contract added to Phase 3D docs

### Contract
- Canonical fields: `job_id`, `title`, `company`, `location`, `url`, `source`, `posted_at`
- `job_id` = SHA‑256 of lower‑trimmed `title|company|url`, truncated to 16 hex
- Sorted output and de‑duplication by `job_id`
- Adapters disabled by default; functions remain pure

### Compatibility
- No breaking changes; orchestrator is opt‑in via adapters configuration

### Upgrading
- Enable sources explicitly in `config/env.json` by setting `*_ENABLED=true` and providing endpoint/keys
