## v0.3.4 — Phase 3E: Enrichment Transforms + Orchestrator Integration

### Highlights
- Deterministic enrichment transforms for canonical job entries.
- Orchestrator applies enrichment post dedup/order to produce enriched outputs.
- Outreach and resume tailoring scripts consume enriched fields to improve personalization and focus.

### Changes
- New module: `automation/job-discovery/scripts/enrichment_transforms.py`
  - `seniority`, `domain_tags[]`, `stack[]`, `skills[]` inferred from role/title (+ optional description).
  - Pure functions; deterministic outputs.
- Orchestrator: `automation/job-discovery/scripts/sources.py`
  - Applies `enrich_job()` after cross-source de-duplication and sorted ordering by `job_id`.
  - Safe import via `importlib.util` for compatibility with hyphenated package directory.
- Outreach: `automation/outreach/scripts/outreach_generator_v1.py`
  - Demonstrates enriched fields for prompt context.
- Resume: `automation/resume-tailoring/scripts/resume_tailor_v1.py`
  - Demonstrates tailoring focus via enriched fields.
- Docs: `docs/phase3D_extended_sources_transforms.md`
  - Enrichment Contract (Phase 3E): added fields and determinism guarantees.

### Compatibility
- Enrichment is additive; canonical base fields remain unchanged.
- Adapters remain pure and config-gated; orchestrator dedup/order unchanged pre-enrichment.

### Testing
- Added unit tests: `tests/enrichment/test_enrichment_transforms.py`.
- Full test suite passing.

### Next
- Expand keyword aliases and taxonomy coverage with real data.
- Incorporate adapter `description` where available to improve inference quality.
